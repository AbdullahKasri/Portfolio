# Credit Card Default Prediction using XGBoost

In this project, I explore a simulated dataset to classify which customers are likely to default on their credit card loans using supervised machine learning techniques. The data consists of various demographic and financial attributes of the customers, along with a binary label indicating whether or not they defaulted on their credit card loans.

I use Python and the XGBoost algorithm to preprocess the data, train and tune a classification model, and evaluate its performance on a holdout set.

The project includes the following files:

- `credit_card_default.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook containing the code and analysis for the project.
- `UCI_Credit_Card.csv`: The original dataset used for the analysis.

## Technologies used:
- Python
- scikit-learn library
- XGBoost library


Please note that the data used in this project is simulated and does not contain any actual personal information.
