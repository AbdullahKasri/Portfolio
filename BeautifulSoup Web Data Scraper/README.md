# Web Scraper for Tabular Data

This program allows you to extract tabular data from any website by providing a URL. It is implemented using Python and the `beautifulsoup4` library.

To use the program, simply run `web_scraper.py` and input the URL of the website containing the tabular data you want to extract. The program then uses `beautifulsoup4` to scrape the data and saves it as a CSV file.

The project includes the following files:

- `web_scraper.py`: The main program file that handles the web scraping and data extraction.
- `requirements.txt`: A file containing the required Python packages for running the program.

## Technologies used:
- Python
- beautifulsoup4 library
