# Handwritten Digit Recognition using CNN

In this project, I develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. The CNN model is designed to learn the features of the input images and classify them into their respective digits.

Using this model, I build a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to draw their own digits and get real-time predictions from the model. This provides an interactive experience and allows users to see the model in action. 
## The project includes the following files:

- digit_recognition.ipynb: A Jupyter notebook containing the code and analysis for the project.
- mnist_model.h5: The saved model weights.
- gui.py: The Python file for the GUI.


## Technologies used:
- Python
- Keras
- Tkinter
