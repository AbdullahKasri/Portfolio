# Handwritten Digit Recognition using CNN

In this project, I use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. First, I preprocess the data and build and train the CNN model using Python and Keras. Then, I design a GUI for the users to draw their own digits and see real-time predictions from the model.

## The project includes the following files:

- digit_recognition.ipynb: A Jupyter notebook containing the code and analysis for the project.
- mnist_model.h5: The saved model weights.
- gui.py: The Python file for the GUI.


## Technologies used:
- Python
- Keras
- Tkinter
