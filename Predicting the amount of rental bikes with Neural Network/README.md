# Bike Rental Demand Prediction using Deep Learning

In this project, I set out to predict the number of bikes being rented hourly based on weather, season, and time data. Given the complex nature of the problem, a Deep Learning model, such as Multi Layer Perceptron, was a perfect candidate to tackle it.

The project includes the following steps:

1. Data collection: Gathered data on bike rental demand, weather, and other relevant factors.
2. Data preprocessing: Cleaned and processed the data to prepare it for modeling.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed the data to gain insights and identify any patterns or correlations.
4. Model training: Built and trained a Deep Learning model using Keras to predict bike rental demand.
5. Model evaluation: Evaluated the model's performance using various metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

The final model achieved an accuracy of 99%.
