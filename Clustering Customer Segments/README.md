# Customer Segmentation using K-means Clustering

In this project, I explore a global retail dataset and attempt to group the customers based on their demographics, behavior, and patterns using the K-means clustering algorithm.

The dataset includes transactional data for a UK-based online retailer from 2010-2011, with over 500,000 rows of data. Using Python and scikit-learn, I preprocess the data, perform feature engineering, and apply the K-means clustering algorithm to identify distinct customer segments.

The project includes the following files:

- `model.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook containing the code and analysis for the project.
- `Online Retail.xlsx`: The original dataset used for the analysis.

## Technologies used:
- Python
- scikit-learn library
