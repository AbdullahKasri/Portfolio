## House Price Prediction with Machine Learning: A Case Study

Are you interested in predicting the value of houses in the USA? Look no further than this amazing project! This case study uses Machine Learning (linear regression) to model important variables and accurately predict the values of houses.

Using data obtained from Bruce, P., Bruce, A., & Gedeck, P. (2020). Practical Statistics for Data Scientists, this project goes beyond just predicting house prices. It also analyzes the performance of the model using residuals, autocorrelation, and heteroscedasticity.

But that's not all! As a bonus, a Flask web app has been designed so that you can easily access the model, enter your house-related variables, and receive a live price prediction.

The project includes the following files:

- `model.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook containing the code and analysis for the project.
- `train_sample.csv`: A random sample (50k observations) from the original dataset used for training.
- `test_sample.csv`: A random sample (10k observations) from the original dataset used for testing.

## Technologies used:
- Python
- scikit-learn library
- Flask
- Pandas
