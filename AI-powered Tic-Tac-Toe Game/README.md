# Tic-Tac-Toe Game with AI

In this Tic-Tac-Toe game, you're playing against an AI that's determined to beat you! The game is implemented using Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

To play the game, simply run `game.py`. The game starts with the AI randomly selecting a spot to place its first move. The game continues with you and the AI taking turns placing your respective marks (X or O) on the board until someone wins or the game ends in a draw.

The project includes the following files:

- `game.py`: The main game file that handles the game logic and user inputs.
- `player.py`: A module that defines the AI `Player` class and its methods.

## Technologies used:
- Python
- OOP principles
